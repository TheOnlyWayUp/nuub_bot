Spent a lot of time in the background
I know I spent a lot of time in the background
Everytime that we're together I black out
Everytime that we're together she tap out
I remember, but she part of my past now
I remember all this shit from the past now
Took a pill and we pass out
I made a deal with the devil
You know I got my problems
Know you got yours too, know you got yours too
Hold on to my revolver, daddy looking for you
Oh girl, don't even bother, why she act brand new?
Take what the devil offers, I got nothing to lose

Sometimes life gets fucked up
That's why we get fucked up
I can still feel your touch
I still do the same drugs
Sometimes life gets fucked up
That's why we get fucked up
I can still feel your touch
I still do the same drugs
That we used to do, I was used to you
"What have you been through? ", she asked me
Every fucking kind of abuse
If you love me too, you would give me you
Lock me in your room, don't tell me the truth
Everything you said, stayed inside my head
All the shit you said
All the blood I bled
Sometimes life gets fucked up
That's why we get fucked up
I can still feel your touch
I still do the same drugs
Sometimes life gets fucked up
That's why we get fucked up
I can still feel your touch
Running up that hill, you pushin' me back
Think that I can make you want it bad
I don't need it though
(I don't need it though)
Sometimes you make me wait and make it like a plan
Wish that you could help me understand
Why? Because I don't know (I dunno)
Sometimes I feel that weight, I hold that in my chest
Sometimes I hold it back, other times I'm blessed
Other times I want more, you put me in debt
I want you like so alive
Wanna be like so inside, wanna be like
Fore me want you to be more into it than this
For me I want more than you seem to wanna give
I see passion in the way you turn your back
Money and the ice, I put upon your wrist
There's a silhouette inside, a lucid dream
I project myself on you, then back to me
There's a reason that she doesn't call me back
It's the way, it is the way it really seem
There's a vision of an altar now, me and the one
Some passing on and out
(And out, and out)
It wasn't something that I thought about
But knew that you were absolute in doubt
It wasn't something that I thought about
But knew that you were absolute in doubt
I just really wanna talk to you again
That's how I know that I'ma haunt you in the end
It wasn't something 'til you brought it up
I knew that you were trying to make it out
Without a single scar, clawing at my arm
I saw you in his car, swear I knew it from the start
Bring me down, it's not that easy
Lay me down, just please don't leave me
I remember you were climbing on top of me
Why you acting like you fucking forgot me?
I've been dreaming about a place out in Hollywood
I just wanna see you smile, I just wanna make you mine
We can spend time, smoke away the time
We can go anywhere you ever wanted
Anything you ever dreamed
I can make your dreams come true
I'll be on my own, no crew
Out here making these moves
Singing these big city blues
I don't wanna think about you
Every time I think about you
I swear I fall in love again
I remember everything you said
Promise me it's real
Girl, I got a deal
You could be my girl if I could be your world
Promise me it's real
Girl, I got a deal
You could be my girl if I could be your world
Coldhart
And we can leave this club
And we can get fucked up
In the back of the Chevy
Girl, I felt your heart beating heavy for me
And I just wanna see you shine
Girl, you got stars for eyes
And she sweet like Texas tea
With a ass from Tennessee
And we can take the long way home
'Cause I don't wanna see you go
Sitting drinking whiskey, hoping that you miss me
Baby say you do (please say you do)
She said I'm a crybaby, I can't be up lately
Girl you drive me crazy, AMG Mercedes
Speeding down the highway, looking at the street lights
Geeking on a Friday, I can never sleep right
Knowing I hurt you, I don't deserve you
I should've curved you, I know I'm the worst boo
But I could be cool too, and you got them dance moves
And I got this vibe, I swear it's perfect to ride to
I wanna die too, we all wanna die too

And I don't listen to y'all
I'm equipped for the fall
And the winter and all
When the summer come
I'ma have enough to get the fuck out
I could buy a truck and
Drive that motherfuckin truck out (skrr)
Trying to buy luck
If you don't die that means you lucked out
I ain't tryna fuck
My time is here and I'm making it clear
Oh I love you my dear
But I'm going, I'm gone
I might come back when the Benz all black
Ten racks on my lap
If I don't relapse and I stay strong
I could do anything I want to
Bump Lil Peep, when I die I'mma haunt you
I could live forever if I want to
I could stop time but I never wanna do that again
Nothing worse than losing a friend
And the feeling you get when everybody that you love ain't around
I really gotta get away from this town
I'm just waiting for a wave and I'll drown
Satan letting me down
I just wanna help you see, you should run away from me
Baby I'm a drug and I don't wanna hurt you
No I'm not gonna hurt you girl, not at all
I ain't gonna set you free
All you gonna get from me
Little bit a love and a little virtue
Everytime I hit the dope I have a new dream
Havin' visions of everybody who knew me
See my face on the motherfucking big screen
Live forever bitch I'm smoking on that HD
Knock, knock, bitch I'm kicking in the front doe
Live forever get them motherfuckin blunts rolled
Now I pull up and I get it how I want hoe
Now I pull up not on purpose and I stunt hoe
I got problems with your motherfucking god
I been working like I never had a job
Everytime I hit the dope I have a new dream
Havin' visions of everybody who knew me
See my face on the motherfucking big screen
I could take it all and all and all
Mirror on the wall, mirror on the wall
I could make her fall and fall and fall
Spirits in the hall, mirror on the wall
Money getting tall and tall and tall
I know I'mma ball, mirror on the wall
I could make it all and all and all
I ain't picking up a call, mirror on the wall
I could take it all and all and all
Mirror on the wall, mirror on the wall
I could make her fall and fall and fall
I can see it in your eyes, that u wanna get high
I can see it in your eyes, that u need it right now
How you need it right now
How you wanna get high
How you need it right now
How you wanna good bye..
I just wanna hear a sign from the narrow side of town
Baby we grillin' right now (woah)
Yeah I just wanna feel alive, baby take your time
Smoking on the spot (woah)
Girl you know you make my cold heart warm with a touch
One kiss then we fuckin'
I just can't get enough
Put it on me that's the best part baby the trust
Trust me
I got nothing for you other than love
I remember eatin' pussy on the back of the bus
I remember gettin' nookie till the sun came up
All the places that you took me no one came with us
Pick me up, pick me up and drive around
Pick me up, pick me up and leave this town
Pistol on my side when she's not around
Bitch I, bitch I wanna die when you throw it down
Pick me up, pick me up and drive around
Pick me up, pick me up, we'll leave this town
Pistol on my side when she's not around
Bitch I, bitch I wanna die when you throw it down
She said she ain't never coming back
She ain't never coming back
I ain't never coming back bitch
Now they wanna put me on a track
Can't put me on a track
Can I put u on my tracklist?
I'd rather watch you bleed to death

Lying to myself

You could stand aside

That's why she always crying tell me that
I'll live forever thru my vibe
I can never die
I got too much pride
That's why she always crying tell me that
I'll live forever thru my vibe
That's why she always crying tell me that
I remember when you used to hold me close and say you love me
Now you acting like a ghost and that's okay I know I'm ugly
Now I'm swerving in the ghost and I'm okay I'm getting money
Now I'm switching up the coast, get out my way I stop for nothing
Give me some time and give me your patience
Came in the game last one month, fuck the game I'm done
Give me a sign and I'm going to take it
Whatever way I want
Bitch I get payed up front
I'm getting mine so fuck all your placements
Baby face I'm done
Fuck the place I'm from
Don't hit my line and say something basic
If it ain't about the money
Please don't waste no time
Looking out the edge, and I'm picturing the fall
I don't want to break my legs and have to carry on
If I carry on I'm gon' need some marijuana
Worry 'bout yourself baby, I'll be good
I just wanna die in peace tonight
You can see it in my face, so I wear my hood
Feeling like it's five degrees tonight
Everybody cold where I come from
Cut your mans down, you was looking for a come up
Next summer, I'll be on a island, with your bitch and a bottle
And a pocket full of numbers
Don't stutter, slang from the gutter, gotta' bang for ya' butter
Got my name from my mother
No other, shining thru' the shutter
Say she over me, whatever cause she underneath my cover
Bet you wish you had my flow
I know I'm dope, I could ask your hoe
Bet you wish you got me mad, you don't, you won't, not never,
Stop blowing up my phone
You wanna run that shit back for me?
Worry 'bout yourself baby, I'll be good
I just wanna die in peace tonight
You can see it in my face, so I wear my hood
Feeling like it's five degrees tonight
Everybody cold where I come from
Cut your mans down, you was looking for a come up
Next summer, I'll be on a island, with your bitch and a bottle
Leave me alone
Just leave alone

She calling my phone

Have you ever seen a man this rich, this broke
this lost in the smoke? Please pray for me
I can never hide, my ghost come everywhere I go, tell heaven don't wait for me
Sitting waiting at the gate for me
I heard this bitch blowing Lil Peep faithfully
That's why these pussies got hate for me
'Cause they was busy chasing bitches, I was chasing dreams
Throw me off the edge, I'll fall
Looking up at 'em like I never even knew them at all
I remember walking around in the hall
And then the bell rang and I tell there's something that I couldn't recall
Making you cry the way she did, I can't forgive myself for
And if you want me to, I'll kill myself but I'm already in hell for
You used to love me then, I know it's not the same
But this is not the end 'cause everything gon' change
When I get that Benz, I'ma pull up in the rain and I'm gon' say
You weren't there
(Skrrt)

When I'm coming down
The lights will brighten
And the noise rings in my head
Did I let you down again..
If I leave here now
It won't feel right
With somebody else in my bed
And I'm breaking down again..
But if I need to go
Just to show you I don't fucking care
If you don't give a shit bout me at all
You little bitch, that's cool with me
So act like you don't know
And I won't fucking stare at anybody else
The way I do, when it's only me and you..
It's me
My arms are searching for you
My arms are stretched out towards you
I feel you on my finger tips
I use to dream of you
Na,I use to lose my sleep for you
But now I see right through
And everybody wanna fuck with me
But I'on fuck witchu
I use to scream at you
I use to turn my cheek at you
But now I need you too
And everybody give a fuck bout me
And I ain't nothing to you
I'm just looking at my life while it go down the drain
I got pain in my brain,But I don't never complain
I'm insane I'm deranged,I see your face at the rain
This ain't no race for the fame,But at this pace I'ma make it
Face it, you basic, Lil Peep you're replacement
I'm taking your spot
I'll give it back when I'm raking the gwap
Maybe not
I keep on checking statements
I'm checking for payments
While you checking ya plays bitch
I been doing my own thing lately
I been holdin my own thing for safety
I don't pick up the phone till they pay me
They asking me how it feel, I say it's crazy
You know it's fucked when the pain feel nice
Cheap liquor on ice, nice
I'm tryna get you out my head tonight (tonight)
I'm tryna get you out my fucking life (fucking life, right)
Then we fucked, then she sucked me off twice
Then I left that bitch alone like I was right, fucking right (wrong)
In your thong smokin' strong outta bong
What the fuck, and I'm tryna make this song (ay, ay)
Young white prick, I get a kick out hittin' licks
Watch how I kick out yo bitch, just so I could cut my wrist
Bitch I'm tatted out my shirt so I can't work, I make it flip
Pour my 40 in the dirt then light my dutch and take a sip
I hear voices in my head, they tellin' me to call it quits
I found some Xanax in my bed
I took that shit, went back to sleep
They gon' miss me when I'm dead, I lay my head and rest in peace
I'm praying to the sky and I don't even know why
Ohhhh, I don't think I can take this anymore
Noooo, washing the blood from my wrist on the floor
Ohhhh, fuck is you talkin' bout my shit is dope
Play this shit when they put me in a hole for eternity
so they can reap what they sow
Ohhhh, I don't think I can do nothing but flow
Noooo, I don't know what she be fuckin' me for
Ohhhh, I don't know why you in love with me hoe
I keep amphetamines up in my coat
Cut my ties and hold my breath
Let the tie do all the rest
What if life comes after death
Grab my knife I nail myself
All the nights I spent on you
All the lights inside my room
All the fights that we sought through
Fool me twice put the blame on you
(Cut my ties and hold my breath
Let the tie do all the rest
What if life comes after death)
Grab my knife I nail myself
All the nights I spent on you
All the lights inside my room
All the fights that we sought through
Fool me twice then its shame on u
Where did you go this time
What if I lose my mind
What if I make you cry
What if I die
Laying on my back now
Lay another track down
Brought the Black cats out, bad luck
If you wanna snap now, tryna take a cap now
Bring the black cats out, now you're fucked
Watch out for the pigs while I ride real slow
Smoking thracks, read my tats from the backseat
Why you throwing shade like you finna face me
You were always bitch, need a Maxi
Half of your pussy blood dripping down your skinny's
I could serve you for some 20's but my racks free
Young bitch I got plenty in my bottle it say Remy on my belt
That shit say Fetti in the back, green (bling)
Got me talking bout my clothes girl
When I fall won't you pick me up
I'm talking bout my old girl
When I call she don't pick it up
My head hurt from the drugs
It's something in the bud man I need a new plug
I feel it in my veins
All my bitches dumb cause they give me all their brains
Put me on the map now
I could hold a map down
See me in the background
Rolling up
I don't gotta rap loud
Bitch I got that trap sound
Autotune my strap with the Cobra Clutch
Watch out for the bitch in the black Range Rover
Driving fast when she listening to Max B
Got the tats on her ass and the black ski mask in the back
If you tryna get your ass beat
One for the money blow
Two for the show my flow go perfect with a sad beat
Everywhere I go all I ever see is snow
In the summertime pussy make me happy
Got me talking bout my clothes girl
Won't you pick me up
I'm talking bout my old girl
When I call she don't pick it up
My head hurt from the drugs
It's something in the bud man I need a new plug
I got a feeling that I'm not gonna be here for next year
So lets laugh a little 'fore I'm gone
I've been dreaming of this shit for awhile now
Got me high now
She don't love me but she's singing my song
Oh no
I don't feel much pain
Got a knife in my back and a bullet in my brain
I'm clinically insane
Walking home alone I see faces in the rain
Where did all the time go?
Spend it getting high while I hide from the 5-0
Where did all the lines gow?
Now I'm so high I be fucking with my eyes closed
She don't fuck with me no more, I'm on her mind though
Come and fuck me in the morning with the blinds closed
I can show you everything I learned
While you were away from me
Running away from me but I'm not giving up on you
It's just the way I be
It's just the way I see things
Take her away from me but I'm not giving up on you no
It's just the way I be
Yeah-eah-eah-eah
She's trying to find the...
She's trying to find the words
I'm trying to find this girl
But it's so dark and I was under club lights
Call me on my iphone
I don't pick it up much
I've been losing friends, I don't feel right
4 Gold Chains, gave 2 to my brothers
Fame bring pain, but the pain make money
Keep it 100 baby girl what's your number?
Girls numb the pain and the drugs get me numb-er

Bet your girl know lil peep and lil tracy, we ride
Your mama tell me that I'm pretty, I get that a lot
He be actin' like he real, but it's just a mirage
She asked me if I wanna die, all I said was yeah
Yah, all I said was yeaaah
Now she all up on my dick when the music drop
Hit the mall, fill my pockets up it then I shop
And I need a fat stack, I can't fuck with knots
Bitches run around the lobby, sleepin' at the top
Back in the day, me and squad, we was juggin' raw
Now we pull up to the mall, we look and we cop
Now they treat me like a star, I act like I'm not
Ain't nobody ever told you how I love you
Nobody ever told you how I feel about you
Okay, I admit I wanna fuck you
But it doesn't change the way I feel about you
I been by myself for a long time
I just wish that I could know if I was on your mind
Running out of time
I just wish that I could know if you were by my side
On the day I die, would you even cry?
If I end my life, would you hold me tight then?
Ain't nobody ever told you how I love you
Nobody ever told you how I feel about you
Okay, I admit I wanna fuck you
But it doesn't change the way I feel about you
I been by myself for a long time
I just wish that I could know if I was on your mind
Running out of time
I just wish that I could know if you were by my side
On the day I die, would you even cry?
You'll only see us in the back
GothBoiClique, all black
I knew love once, it's hard to forget
I thought of you and nights spent
When I'm backed against the wall
I thought of her and highly
'Cause she answered when I called
I want her to wanna hurt me
And I miss 2013 love songs
(And I'm so lost), under club lights
(In the all black), GothBoiClique
GothBoi, I'm the one you can't avoid
No choice, baby, I be makin' noise
GothBoi, I'm the one you can't avoid
No choice, no choice
Lookin' for you in the back of the club
Lookin' for her in the back of the club, fucked up
Everybody know I numb it with the drugs
Everybody know I numb it with the drugs
(Fucked up in the back of the club)
Cast a sigil in the back of the club
(I got scars on me, no love)
Light a candle and I pray for doves
(And you're fadin' away, like the pill under my tongue)
We seriously never even touched, it sucks
(I'ma put your name in my skin, mix the ink in my blood)
(It's so fucked)
So tell me what is love
(If I ever had it), if I ever had it
(Did I really want it?)
(And why can't I remember?)
I cannot remember
I took the black two-seater when you pushed me away
Into the dark, I only want what's best for you, baby
I reach out to you, but slowly
If there's passion there, then show me
Fast, hard
(It's a slow drug)
And I swear that
(But it's true love)
These are true lines
Saw you in the back of the club again
And we just started textin' again
And now you sendin' pictures to my phone, like I just can't resist
I'm tryin' not to let you feel missed
And now we're in the bar, like 6 PM
And now we took a bottle to your bed
Listenin' to Slowdive, eyes like so-so red
And I can't stop starin' at the back of your neck
And you think you can make me love again
I swear that I will never feel a thing
Hollow shell, quiet hell, but you're so into me
Screamin', "Why don't you love me back?"
'Cause it's GothBoiClique, 'til my lungs collapse
GothBoi, I'm the one you can't avoid
No choice, baby, I be makin' noise
GothBoi, I'm the one you can't avoid
No choice, no choice
Lookin' for you in the back of the club
Lookin' for her in the back of the club, fucked up
Everybody know I numb it with the drugs
Telling me you love me while we fucking in the backseat
Back of the club with the clique if you ask me
I don't wanna talk, I don't need friends
I'ma get a Benz, will you love me 'til the end?
Telling me you love me while we fucking in the backseat
Back of the club with the clique if you ask me
I don't wanna talk, I don't need friends
I'ma get a Benz, will you love me 'til the end?
I know you love xans, but there is no way
you forgot about the way that I held your hand
Should we try again, give it another chance
I don't think it's worth it, I don't think it's worth it
Pouring red wine in a chalice
I sip slow, can't spill it on my fabric
You're like a switchblade, cut right through me
I kinda like it though, baby, cut through me
Vampire in the club in the back now
Heartthrob girls have me as their background
I don't care though, I want you to care though
I cast a love spell, baby, you'll be back though
Telling me you love me while we fucking in the backseat
Back of the club with the clique if you ask me
I don't wanna talk, I don't need friends
I'ma get a Benz, will you love me 'til the end?
Telling me you love me while we fucking in the backseat
Back of the club with the clique if you ask me

Or hold it against you
I know that you're leaving
You must have your reasons
The season is calling
Your pictures are falling down
The steps that I retrace
The sad look on your face
The timing and structure
Did you hear he fucked her?
A day late, a buck short
I'm writing the report
On losing and failing
When I move I'm flailing now
And it's happened once again
I'll turn to a friend
Someone that understands
Sees through the master plan
But everybody's gone
And I've been here for too long
To face this on my own
Well, I guess this is growing up
Well, I guess this is growing up
And maybe I'll see you
At a movie sneak preview
You'll show up and walk by
On the arm of that guy
And I'll smile and you'll wave
We'll pretend it's okay
The charade, it won't last
When he's gone, I won't come back
And it'll happened once again
You'll turn to a friend
Someone that understands
And sees through the master plan
But everybody's gone
And you've been there for too long
To face this on your own
Well, I guess this is growing up
Well, I guess this is growing up
Well, I guess this is growing up
Well, I guess this is growing up

But I got racks and she loving on my tats
I'll be right here, when you step out the car
I see you from afar, but I know who you are
I know exactly who you are, what you're looking for
I know exactly where it starts, and I'm not looking forward to the end
Because we're not gonna last
Because we took it too fast, and that's a good way to crash and burn
What I learned, I don't like taking my turn
If she mine, she gon' be mine until we ash in an urn
Let me burn, let me swerve, let me pull up on the curb
Now I'm looking so absurd, But I'm all that they heard, at the party pull-up rari
Up in the haze on the scene up in the haze on the scene
Light a hundred fuckin' dutchs and then I follow my dreams
Girl you're fuckin with Lil Peep, I'm the king of the teens
I just dropped a couple singles and take over the scene
Got the internet buzzing, 20 thousand a week
Now I practice getting pussy, I practice all that I preach
Peep
I'll be right there when you need me close
I'll always be around when you need me the most
But I know, that you've been trying to get away from me
But you just don't know what to say to me
I just gotta do what I think I'm meant to
Everything I said is true in that text I sent you
So if you ain't gon' be my boo, then just do you
I'm smoking blunts, like they cigarettes
I still ain't shit, I ain't gotten any bigger yet
But that factor ain't something that really matters to me
Ain't nothing to think about when I'm chilling, smoking my weed
I burn it down, and then proceed to seek out all my hopes and dreams
The future holds itself so it ain't really what it seems
If I can't get to where I want, I'll be pissed
I do a lot of drugs and I hate it
But I love it, dope got me famous
Screaming fuck fame, go get some money
Screaming fuck lames, I'm one hunnit
I do a lot of drugs and I hate it
But I love it, dope got me famous
Screaming fuck fame, go get some money
Fuck lames, I got my brothers

Screaming fuck fame, go get some money

Pussy pop like a bottle and it's wet like Moscato

But I love it, bitch I'm high as fuck in public
Step in the club with Lil Peep these bitches love it
Cameras flashing, lights camera action
Fuck fame, I want hundreds

All you know bout me is that people know me

You had that shallow heart and I had those big dreams
And I'd do anything that you would ask from me
I would blow my brains out just for you
And honestly to tell you the truth
I'd still blow my brains out just for you
Do you remember when you didn't care 'bout me?

She keep cryin', I keep lyin' but the true is I won't save her
So now she hates me but that's fine, because I hate my self

Look at my face while you talking to me
Cause we only have one conversation a week
Can I get one conversation at least?
Shout out to everyone making my beats, you helping me preach

Look at the sky tonight, all of the stars have a reason
A reason to shine, a reason like mine and I'm falling to pieces

I know that it hurts sometimes, but it's beautiful
Workin' every day, now you bleedin' through your cuticles
Passin' through a portal as you're just sittin' in your cubicle
Isn't life beautiful? I think that life is beautiful
Tryna keep it cool at your grandfather's funeral
Findin' out eventually the feelin' wasn't mutual
You were not invited 'cause you're nothin' like the usual
Isn't life beautiful? I think that life is beautiful
You wanna see your friends, but you're stuck inside a hospital
Doctor walks in and he tells you that it's terminal
Tumor in your brain and they say that It's inoperable
Isn't life beautiful? I think that life is beautiful
They'll kill your little brother and they'll tell you he's a criminal
They'll fuckin' kill you too, so you better not get physical
Welcome to America, that type of shit is typical
Isn't life beautiful? I think that life is beautiful
Wake up in the mornin', now you doin' the impossible
Find out what's important, now you feelin' philosophical
When I die I'll pack my bags, move somewhere more affordable
Isn't life horrible? I think that life is horrible
You think she's adorable, she thinks that you're intolerable
You think you can do it, but your chances are improbable
Once you feel unstoppable, you run into an obstacle
Isn't life comical? I think that life is comical
And if you ever need a friend then you got me
And in the end, when I die, would you watch me?
And if I tried suicide, would you stop me?
Would you help me get a grip or would you drop me?
Runaway, make friends with the moon
Why you trippin'? You'll be with your friends soon
There comes a time when everybody meets the same fate
I think I'ma die alone inside my room
Isn't life beautiful? I think that life is beautiful
Isn't life beautiful? I think that life is beautiful
Isn't life beautiful? I think that life is beautiful
