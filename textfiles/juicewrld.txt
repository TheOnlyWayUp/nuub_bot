I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you so I must replace you (oh)
Easier said than done
I thought you were the one
Listening to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but
I am the better one
I won't let you forget me

I have these lucid dreams where I can't move a thing
Thinking of you in my bed

Thoughts of a wedding ring

I didn't want it to end
I watch it blow in the wind
I should've listened to my friends
Did this shit in the past
But I want it to last
You were made outta plastic (fake)
I was tangled up in your drastic ways
Who knew evil girls have the prettiest face
You gave me a heart that was full of mistakes
I gave you my heart and you made heart break
You made my heart break
You made my heart ache (I still see your shadows in my room)
You made my heart break
You made my heart ache (can't take back the love that I gave you)

From the unknown
I ran away, I don't think I'm comin' back home
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa
Like a crawl space, this a dark place I roam
Ain't no right way, just the wrong way I know
I problem-solve with styrofoam
My world revolves around a black hole
The same black hole that's in place of my soul
I'm empty, I feel so God damn empty
I may go rogue, don't tempt me
Big bullet holes, tote semi autos
Oh, yeah, I'm keepin' it real, real
I'm keepin' it real
Oh, yeah, life gets tough, shit is getting real
Yeah, I don't know how to feel
Swallowing all these pills
Not my real feels
Uh, devil standing here tryna make a deal, uh
It ain't no deal, feel like I'm goin' crazy but still it took a lot to get me here
Losing my sanity up in the house on the hills, hills, hills
I didn't have vanity then and I still don't have vanity still, still, still
Bein' me, I rock PnB
These hoes actin' like gossip, TMZ these drugs
Actin' like mosh pits, squishin' me, oh my
Oh me, how they kill me slowly
Lonely, I've been gettin' no peace
OD, feel like overdosing
Low key I have been looking for signs
But all I can find is the sign of the times
From the unknown
I ran away, I don't think I'm comin' back home
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa
Like a crawl space, this a dark place I roam
Ain't no right way, just the wrong way I know
I problem solve with styrofoam
My world revolves around a black hole
The same black hole that's in place of my soul
I'm empty, I feel so God damn empty
I may go rogue, don't tempt me
Big bullet holes, tote semi autos
I ain't suicidal
Only thing that's suicide is suicide doors
Fight for survival
Gotta keep hope up, rolling good dope up
Hold my hand, through hell we go
Don't look back, it ain't the past no more
Gonna get to them racks on them n****s, whoa-whoa
Yeah, I was put here to lead the lost souls
Exhale depression as the wind blows
These are the laws of living in vogue
We're perfectly imperfect children
Rose from the dust, all of us are on a mission
Never gave a fuck, really came from rags to riches
Now we live it up, drivin' with the rooftop missin'
I don't give a fuck, really came from rags to riches
Now I live it up, drivin' with the rooftop missin'
From the unknown
I ran away, I don't think I'm comin' back home
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa
Like a crawl space, this a dark place I roam
Ain't no right way, just the wrong way I know

My world revolves around a black hole
The same black hole that's in place of my soul
I'm empty, I feel so God damn empty
I may go rogue, don't tempt me

Don't think just 'cause you grip the wheel
Makes you a straight-up rider for real
I don't know, oh I don't know
If I should give you the key to my soul
I don't know, no, I don't know
My paranoia and insecurities hold me close
Let me down asleep with my casket closed
Nail it shut, make sure not to leave a thing exposed
I don't know, oh I don't know
Blonde hair don't care, please don't leave me froze
Stuffed cigarillos and Perc's keep me a hoe
Shoulda shot it in the head, words from my bro
But anything for romance, so I'ma risk it all
Oh oh
Let's see if you a rider for real
I really wanna see if you a rider for real
Don't think just 'cause you grip the wheel
Makes you a straight-up rider for real
I don't know, oh I don't know

My paranoia and insecurities hold me close
I'm Codeine Cobain, I'm a I'ma pour a four
I don't do cocaine but it's Perc in my nose
I suffer from excessive road rage
Take my life and crash it into this hoe
It don't matter, you can have my heart
Kill me faster, what's mine is yours
On a platter
I watched you grab that dagger
She's a stabber
But is she a rider?
Or is she poison?
A viper?
She gets me high, a supplier
And I'm on fire
Will she be my fire-fighter?
Let's see if you a rider for real
I really wanna see if you a rider for real
Don't think just 'cause you grip the wheel
Makes you a straight-up rider for real
I don't know, oh I don't know

I don't feel like comin' to the phone today
I wish everyone would leave me alone
I don't feel like comin' to the phone today
Race
Ring ring
I don't feel like comin' to the phone today
Everyone should just leave me alone
I don't feel like comin' to the phone today
But I don't feel like bein' alone
I can't deal with the chills on my own
Freezin' all night long
I can't tell what's real
Or where I belong
All day today, same thoughts
This is all the Devil's fault
I ain't mean to name-drop
Often I'll pop all three
I'm off all three
Should I make it four like the rings on my Audi
Xans with the Everclear got me seein' foggy
Ironic how somethin' clear got me seein' foggy
Somethin' ain't right 'bout the pills but I bought 'em
Somethin' ain't right with my mind, so I lost it
Drugs turn my knob, then I run like some faucets
But it ain't water, it's wine
I'm tired, I'm tired of gettin' high
It's exhaustin'
I was told it gets better in time
Ring, ring
I don't feel like comin' to the phone today
Everyone should just leave me alone
I don't feel like comin' to the phone today
But I don't feel like bein' alone
I can't deal with the chills on my own
Freezin' all night long
I can't tell what's real
Or where I belong
I don't feel like comin' to the phone today
Unless a Postmates comin' on the way
But my cellphone isn't well, no
Go to Hell
"Oh pretty please
Get me these"
"Buy me this"
"Buy me that"
Bitch, hit your knees
I wasn't prepared for a guest
I'm aware of the stress
I don't care to impress
Can't you see that I am hight on drugs
And low on sleep?
I just wanna go somewhere and count my sheep
I'm tired, I'm tired of gettin' high
It's exhausting
I was told it gets better in time
I don't feel like comin' to the phone today
Everyone should just leave me alone
I don't feel like comin' to the phone today
But I don't feel like bein' alone
I can't deal with the chills on my own
Freezin' all night long
I can't tell what's real
Man, what? (Haha)
This shit funny
I was like-
Oof, this Hennessy strong as fuck, boy
She told me put my heart in the bag (In the bag)
And nobody gets hurt (No hurt)
Now I'm running from her love, I'm not fast (Fast)
So I'm making it worse (Making it worse)
Now I'm digging up a grave, from my past
I'm a whole different person (I'm a whole different person)
It's a gift and a curse (It's a gift and a curse)
But I cannot reverse it
I can't reverse it
It was a gift and a curse
And now I'm drinkin' too much, so I'ma talk with a slur
Last time I saw you, it ended in a blur
I woke up in a hearse
You said, "You loved me first" (First)
One thing my dad told me was, "Never let your woman know when you're insecure"
So I put Gucci on the fur
And I put my wrist on iceberg
One thing my heart tells me is
"Flex on a ho every time they're insecure"
I guess you came through, I'm running from you
Is your love for real? (For real? For real?)
Is your love really true?
She told me put my heart in the bag (In the bag)
And nobody gets hurt (Hurt)
Now I'm running from her love, I'm not fast (Fast)
So I'm making it worse (Worse)
Now I'm digging up a grave, from my past (Past)
I'm a whole different person (Person)
It's a gift and a curse (Curse)
But I cannot reverse it
You gave me the runaround
I really hate the runaround
You really got me paranoid
I always keep a gun around
You always give me butterflies
When you come around
When you come around
When you come around
You let me know love is not the answer
Not the answer, not the answer
I love to do drugs so mind my manners
I get high when you don't decide to answer
Phone home, I need to phone home
I'm throwing rocks at your window, I need to go home
I don't wanna leave
I just wanna be with you
You, you, you
She told me put my heart in the bag (In the bag)
And nobody gets hurt (No hurt)
Now I'm running from her love, I'm not fast (Fast)
So I'm making it worse (I'm making it worse)
Now I'm digging up a grave, from my past
I'm a whole different person (I'm a whole different person)
It's a gift and a curse (It's a gift and a curse)

I don't know if it's because my heart hurts or because I'm insecure
Baby, you're not her
My last girl had me so fucked up it was a blacked out blur
Baby, you jump first
It's a long way to hell, I ain't really tryna leave this Earth
Baby, do your worst
This is as far as it goes
This the end of the road
This the end of the road, the end of the road
It's suicidal she wrote
This is the end of the show, it's over
We doin' drugs 'til we in a coma
We don't love these hoes, our hearts got colder
It's hard out here for a lonely stoner
I know I'm doin' drugs, just always
Just faded 'cause I never throw up
Pray to God my plug can pour up
Pray to God my plug still show up
I know the last time we tried to rob 'em
He lucky, bro, lil mane fucking off him
I'm drinkin', drivin' in the Bentley coupe so
It's hard for me to drive, move too slow
Told you, baby, I ain't saving no hoe
I only save the money, anti-hero
I burn my old clothes and got some new clothes
I left my old hoes and got some new hoes
I really got a chopper and it's kickin' like judo
He shootin' while I'm drivin' the two-door
This is as far as it goes

The moonrock on me, I love the auroma
Get so high that I'm in the clouds with falling angels
These missles halos
She love the coke but not Coca-Cola
But she'll still pop it like a soda for ya
Her name rings bells like a Motorola
I lay the bitch off like I'm her employer
And she gon' ride like a rollercoaster
And I'm gon' hide when the love is over
But it's far from over, losing composure
In the coffin, laying stiff like a board
This is as far as it goes

I was rocking off-white, tryna have a fun time
She gon' eat like lunch time

My Lil bro keep a 40, they thought his ass was security
Too busy making money, Don't worry 'bout making memories
But in the meantime

My momma told me "stop the painkillers"
Them shits is killing me

Now you got a black eye
I got mob ties
I've got gang ties
Make you drown in your blood, just like high tide
Now I'm up, everybody wanna high five
Remember when they used to diss me in the lunch line
Now I'm eating steak and eggs when it's lunchtime
I remember eating ramen, with a Glock nine
I remember when she left me for the next guy
Now she's calling me her next guy

Ooh, ooh

I'm holding my breath and watching my step
I'm listing regrets, and you made that list
You're my depression, your first impression wasn't deception
You were lyin'
Bitch, I'm still flexin', with my heart broken
Got my heart open, I'm not high yet
Bitch, I'm still moving I'm in slow motion
I wrote my dosage I'm getting higher
Bitch, I still, I still, love my pills, I feel
You can't feel, I feel you can't feel, I feel
Bitch, I still, I still love my pills, I feel
You can't feel, I feel, you can't feel, I feel
Ooh, ooh, oh
Ooh, ooh, oh
Fell in love with your face off the shrooms
The way it animates your eyes in the room
I can see the stars when I'm gazing at you
Now I need the car with the stars in the roof
Elephant all in the room, she buried me in a tomb
I'm feeling over consumed
She walking me to my dorm, I see her face in my room
When im along in the room I'ma blame that on the shrooms
Oh, feeling ridiculed, feeling like a fool, don't know what to do
Lost my heart, don't got shit to lose
I'm holding my breath and watching my step
I'm listing regrets, and you made that list
You're my depression, your first impression wasn't deception

Every fucking time you call me
On Snapchat, and Face- I don't wanna hear from you no more
Alright, I'm gonna hang up on you now, okay?
Stop fucking calling me
I said I hate you, stop calling me
Lose my fucking number because I'm done
Uh, I can't yell no more

I promise you, you want that?
All the shit I did for you, okay
Alright, how 'bout this big shit like you gon' be something
You not gon' be shit, I promise you

Okay, okay, go ahead talk all that shit now
Okay, it's me again (I've called you, like 30 times now! Why can't you answer the phone now?)
And no I have called you back a billion times
Why can't you answer the phone?
What-(yeah!) I know I'm sorry
I told you, that none of that meant nothing to me!
Noth- Nothing meant nothing to me! (I gave you everything!)
He didn't mean anything to me
I told you I was there for you
So you just gone give everything I gave you, to someone else?
You just gone give me all away like that?
n****, you was just calling me! (Yeah you was the one saying all that, but I don't care! I love you! I have always loved you!)
Whatever...
But, I wouldn't- I wouldn't be calling you if I didn't love you
I love you (You don't have hang up the phone, don't hang up the, what are you doing!)
That don't mean shit to me!
But I said I really love you!
Drugs got me sweatin', but the room gettin' colder
Lookin' at the devil and the angel on my shoulder
Will I die tonight? I don't know, is it over?
Lookin' for my next high, I'm lookin' for closure
Lean with me, pop with me
Get high with me if you rock with me
Smoke with me, drink with me
Fucked up liver with some bad kidneys
Lean with me, pop with me
Get high with me if you rock with me
Smoke with me, drink with me
Fucked up liver with some bad kidneys
Told her if I die I'ma die young
Every day I've been gettin' fucked up
Finally know the difference between love and drugs
Shorty tell me I should really sober up
This shit ain't fiction, it's too real, too real
Fuck one dose, I need two pills, two pills
I'm lookin' for trouble so I know I'm gonna find it
Ring, ring, plug hit my phone, perfect timin'
I know I'm not right
But I'm not wrong, no I'm not wrong
Girl, you hate it when I'm too high
But that's where I belong, where I belong
Lean with me, pop with me
Get high with me if you rock with me
Smoke with me, drink with me
Fucked up liver with some bad kidneys
Lean with me, pop with me
Get high with me if you rock with me
Smoke with me, drink with me
Fucked up liver with some bad kidneys
Eyes red, no Visine
Crashed the Mustang, no Saleen
Yeah, I love P's, yeah I love lean
I laugh when they ask if my piss clean
Smoke with me, pop with me
Ayy, Gucci store, come and shop with me
If I overdose, bae, are you gon' drop with me?
I don't even wanna think about that right now
Let's get too high, reach a new high
Take the shrooms and the pills at the same time
Went to Hollywood thrills from the street life
Took too many drugs, now I don't feel right
Lean with me, pop with me
Get high with me if you rock with me
Smoke with me, drink with me
Fucked up liver with some bad kidneys
Lean with me, pop with me
Get high with me if you rock with me
Smoke with me, drink with me
No, no, ...no
I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you so I must replace you (oh)
Easier said than done
I thought you were the one
Listening to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but
I am the better one
I won't let you forget me

I know that you want me dead (cough)
I take prescriptions to make me feel a-okay
I know it's all in my head
I have these lucid dreams where I can't move a thing
Thinking of you in my bed
You were my everything
Thoughts of a wedding ring
Now I'm just better off dead (coughs)
I'll do it over again
I didn't want it to end
I watch it blow in the wind
I should've listened to my friends
Did this shit in the past
But I want it to last
You were made outta plastic (fake)
I was tangled up in your drastic ways
Who knew evil girls have the prettiest face
You gave me a heart that was full of mistakes
I gave you my heart and you made heart break
You made my heart break
You made my heart ache (I still see your shadows in my room)
You made my heart break
You made my heart ache (can't take back the love that I gave you)

It's probably 'cause I'm doin' better than them anyway
It's probably 'cause I get they bitches wetter anyway
It's probably 'cause I'm livin' and I'm in a lower place
They walkin' in their slums while I'm vibin' outer space
Crash land just to take they girl on a dinner date
When haters see me winnin' they just hyperventilate
They always try to stop me but I never hesitate
Just follow all your dreams, and when you reach them celebrate
That's the only way to truly make a hater suffocate
All these fuck n****s on my line

It's a cold day in Hell when they dirty up your name
They ain't got no business talkin' in the first place
I'm freezin', uh
But these haters not breathin'
Stevie Wonder to these haters, no seein', uh
And I don't believe it
Hate me, hate me for no reason
They hate me for no reason, oh
All these fuck n****s on my line
Damn n**** you must wanna die tonight
Yeah, I rock a choker with a .45
And I know some n****s that are down to ride
All these hatin' bitches on my line
Damn bitch, you must wanna fuck tonight
Let me guess, you're my biggest fan, right?
