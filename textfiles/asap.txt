Yeah
I had a good year
All them music festivals and shit
I can't believe MTV crowned me King Bonnaroo
Haha, shit was a party on stage, yeah
Just got back from Bonnaroo, that shit was amazing
Girls crowdsurf to the stage for the booty shaking
Express Yourself set the tone, by Diplo
Today was blazing so they taking off their shit slow
Show them titties, show them titties, me and Marty screaming
TJ on the 1 and 2s, he got the party heating
My DJ making it far, just hope his daddy see him
Jam Master Jay Junior, I know that he can't believe it
He could be the next A-Trak, just keep dreaming
God got me on a mission, n****, I'mma keep preaching
Lords Never Worry, point blank period
We divine and then shine through these dark demons
Flying vultures, bra leeches
Moment you want some pussy, they act like they can't believe it
They got a rap n**** like "well, at least can I see it?"
Claiming you got a man, you was outside my trailer just fiending
Giving me celibate speeches, I got a hell of a penis
Give you that crack pipe, girl, who the hell is your dealer?
She laughing now, you acting mad cause I ain't let you beat it
I play myself anyway cause you the weakest
Now I'm straight off the stage into the tour bus
Had enough of these hoes, it's time to get focused
I couldn't figure what to write
Until I mumbled some words and started on the chorus
All of my life and all of my days
I never thought I would be here, I never thought I would be here
All of my life and all of my days
I never thought I would be here, and I feel it now
and my bones and my body wanna lift off
I spoke to Lauryn last night, man, she still got it
She performed Ready Or Not, the whole set was rocking
Skrillex brought me out before her set, I did Shabba
She said "I watched the whole thing, Ferg, your shit was proper"
Damn, Lauryn was watching my show?
Plus I came out to Juicy and I fucked that Biggie flow
But it was cool cause the crowd caught the words for me
And when I did Work, they sung the whole shit for me
Coogi down to the socks, then the crowd applaud
I'm getting rich so I gotta stop the stage dive
Ain't smoked in a minute, but I sorta get a stage high
Especially when I'm done and the whole crowd stay live
I'm tired as hell, still come out for the encore
Looking fatigued, I'm out of breath, I need to run more
Then I hit my DJ like "we got one more"
And we nod, yeah, then I go for it, like
I wonder why I can't commit sometimes
Somewhere along down the line, it's affecting my mind
Woke up, seen Daddy in bed with another woman
Thought that was Mama, "hey ma"- hold up, that couldn't
Be her, what I'm thinking, cause she just went to work
It was a naked look-a-like and Daddy there with no skirt
See, Daddy was getting busy when I barged in
Then when I said "mommy?", he chuckled and grinned
Then I soon realized that the crust in my eyes
Had the chick looking like Mama love from the side
See, Daddy was a player and I wasn't surprised
He would holla at the girls when we rolled with the guys
Should I hate or embrace these ties?
I mean, I praise this dude, god's sake, he's fly
He couldn't do no wrong in my eyes
But at the same time I hated to see my mama cry
Ain't no wonder why I can't commit sometimes
Somewhere along down the line, it's affecting my mind
And I wonder why I can't commit sometimes
Somewhere along down the line, it's affecting my mind
I've got commitment issues, did from when I was young
Wasn't tryna fit in my uncle's Timberlands, he was dumb
His shoe was too small to fit my big toe in
Ain't wanna walk in his shoes, he was just hoing
He stayed broke, them bitches provided for him
Whether skinny, fat, black or tyrannosaurus
He was a gigolo, and never minded whoring
Guess the money gave him new ways to ignore it
Pussy is pussy, and new clothes the way he saw it
This ain't Enyce n****, what she brought in?
To see him kiss her ass made me nauseous
Then he'd give her sloppy hugs like my baby gorgeous
He was just doing that for the new forces
All this fucking bullshit that had my brain distorted
Ain't no wonder why I can't commit sometimes
Somewhere along down the line, it's affecting my mind
I've got commitment issues, even with my craft
Didn't think Willie Lynch was that good at math
Took a lil black baby 'way from mom and dad
Now he lost in the field and it's so sad
The mind of a slave, at a young age
Can't talk to a girl or know how to engage
He think being a gentleman is wrong and gay
But he feel that way cause that's how he was raised
He watched dad diss mom, she got play
And your uncle only had a girl when he got paid
All this shit put my life in a maze
Then when I grow up, marriage in a haze
Ain't no wonder why I can't commit sometimes
Somewhere along down the line, it's affecting my mind
To all the ladies, I'll just say it one more time
Somewhere along down the line, it's affected our minds
They mad, they mad
They mad, why they mad?
They mad, and they mad
They mad, they mad
They mad, they mad
They mad, and they mad
You mad, you and you mad
I'm ballin', ballin', I'm shot callin'
Gotta brush the gold grills when I wake in the mornin'
You can smell that champagne when a n**** be yawnin'

I got a hundred dollar bill for every bump on your face
This shit make no sense, I got taste
Girls come to my house to have an orgy parade
I just hit 'em like this and leave 'em horny for days
My daddy said I'm a prince, now I'm a king
He sacrificed and went to Heaven, now I'm livin' his dream
You gotta walk like this, you gotta talk like that
I talked this shit into existence, now my stacks on racks
I got stacks on stacks, stacks on racks
Racks on top of stacks and stacks on top of them racks
Move like that on them cats, you move like that and get smacked
I wipe a hundred on my momma, I'm using that like Proac'
I got a hundred dollar bill to get the bump off your face
I got a hundred dollar bill to get them bumps off your face
I got a hundred dollar bill to get them bumps off your face
Got a hundred dollar bill to get them bumps off your face
Use these hundred dollar bills to get these bumps off your face

Got a hundred dollar, got damn
Now I'm lookin' through the window and the sky's so blue
Lookin' through the window and my grass' so green
Lookin' through my window, hold on I know you

I was at Abyssinian playing basketball
But it was different from playing basketball at the park

All that standing on the block just like a Pokemon (pika)
Dope dealers sitting like I gotta catch em' all

We talk about art then end up on sex
We text for hours, you're so complex
Not your average girl in spandex
Who chase Bent-e-leys and Rolex
You wear them baggy jeans like Aaliyah
Your body so mean, I can tell you got a booty like Selena
Girl, you're 'bout to have me catch a fever
I can't lie, I get happy every time a n**** see ya
The way you move, the way you groove
Is so appealing
I'm usually not that dude caught up in all these feelings
I've been around the world and dealt with all these women
Through all these different girls, this is the realest feeling
I'm tired of the waiting (so tired)
I think I want the real thing, I know you got it
I'm tired of lonely (so tired)
I think I want the real thing, I know you got it
What you feel
Don't want you to run away from me darling
This life can be so cold
Now what you feel
Don't want you to run away from me honey
I want us to grow old
Sort of afrocentric, you been thick
Pearly white teeth like you live at the dentist
Impeccable freckle, you put a spell on nigglet
Room full of syringes, she got me addicted
Body authentic, how do you bend it?
Got her too tempted
I don't know how to prevent it
I will go into it, party 'til I go limp dick
Run in that clitoris, like I'm in the Olympics
Swinging that diznick, til it's all in appendix
She be likin' it nasty, I like when you rinse it
Rinse it off like candy rain
Say my name three times like Candyman
Oh, cause our love so so real
That a n**** want to score like Shaquille O'Neal
And she fly like an eagle, so I call her Seal
Let nothing get in between what you feel
I'm tired of the waiting (so tired)
I think I want the real thing, I know you got it
I'm tired of lonely (so tired)
I think I want the real thing, I know you got it
What you feel
Don't want you to run away from me darling
This life can be so cold
Now what you feel
Don't want you to run away from me honey
All I ever wanted was a Clams Casino beat
To talk about oppression
That's repressin' my peeps
Ride around in that green hooptie
With my Uncle T
NWA blastin', we screamin' "fuck the police" (fuck 'em)
Cause they don't give two shits about me
I mean we when I say Ferguson they talk about me
Little brown, Mike Brown
Shot down in Missouri
They keep us in misery
And get a desk job when the coroner leave
They don't even take they badge, a racist act
Just take a president to make 'em black
Hope that we live in bliss
And take a nap to create with the same brush that paint the past
Cause it's still the same shit
We don't run it up for no help
Cause you know we bound to get hit
All I ever wanted was a Clams Casino beat
To talk about these hatin' motherfuckers
Talkin' 'bout me
All I ever wanted was a Clams Casino beat
To talk about these hatin' motherfuckers
Talkin' 'bout me
Let's talk about hate
Hate in the game
Be the same n****s that you made your friend
You give me a beat, they ain't play it then
Then you run around town like you made my name
Showed you nothin' but love
Somethin' strange deranged
Just wanted to see and make some change
What about old friends that claim I change
I ain't changed, I'm grown about my change
All I needed was a Clams Casino beat
To talk about these loyal fans
That be talkin' 'bout me
All I needed was a Clams Casino beat
To talk about these loyal fans
That be talkin' 'bout me
Let's talk about fans
Are they fake or real?
They happy when you make the deal
They build you up to make the kill
To break you down, and claim you ain't real
"Why you do songs with these pop icons
Oh he moved on, dreamed the pay-off
Fly state to state, two white girls in his arms
Mr. Hollywood don't like us no more"
Nah, that's a lie
I like any girl with eyes, cutie pies
Fat ass, sumo thighs
Any complexion, girl you could be mine
I love the fans who truly mine
Respect the come-up, the Fergie grind
Man art can be art sometimes
15 years of my life, I was locked in prison
Thought shit would hold me down, but the clock kept on ticking
Time kept on slipping, plus I just got sentenced
Now my collect calls got your bills going ballistic
I should've been there taking care of the children
And I worried about all them snot-nosed women
While I was in Carolina flipping birds in the kitchen
You heard that wasn't the only type of birds I was flipping
I can make a thug cry, tonight
Watch me make a thug cry, tonight
Cause that's how true love is supposed to be, ain't it?
When it feels so good it shakes all your belief, baby
I can make a thug cry, tonight
(I can make you cry tonight, tonight)
I can make a thug cry, tonight
Then I got married to you, Richard Porter didn't do it
He was too busy getting busy, all of which was foolish
I know you tired of all of my "didn't do it"s
All of my promises and all of my "I'mma prove it"s
You knew something was up when I all of a sudden took two trips
Two trips turned into too many excuses
I gotta hustle two more months, babe, just two flips
Meanwhile, you had me a child and he was toothless
I was living wild down south, had me a new bitch
Brought her ass a brand new car, lived in a new crib
Hmm, second child on the way, juggling two bibs
Then you got a call from shawty like "bitch, who this?"
This is why it finished, baby mama, he got two kids
Tell his funky ass that I'm leaving, fucking doofus
Afraid to come home cause I know what I did was stupid
And you still forgave my stupid ass, uh
There's something about you
Baby we got to get lost in the moment
You and me only
And now that I'm locked up, I expect you to stay
Like somebody coming to kill you and expect you to lay
You stopped sending commisary durags upon me
Guess you figured that other chick'd take care of my ways
Don't you forget you're my wife, like that meant something
Then blow kisses in the phone like that did something
Then you stopped my visits, heard you got pregnant
By that n****, I just act like "y'all been fucking"
But I knew that wasn't true, you was just tired
And somewhere in your heart, my love sit higher
But a good man is what you desire
And this is what it sound like when a thug crying, I'm crying
Let's ask a question of real life
How you gon keep it
You gon keep it trill
You gon keep it real
You gon keep it to yourself
Or you gon keep it away from what it should be
Ask yourself
You was devil walking I mean you never taught me nothing
Talking about you knuck if you buck
You walk through the block as if you was tough
You was always got fucked up
Oh, my uncle got stabbed?
Granddad, he never gave 2 fucks, claimed it was good for your ass
Oh no love from your dad, is that, the reason you act up
Grandma always spoiled you
Even kept your mac tucked in her mattress
How could you ask for trust?
You's a junkie smoked on glass dick and be holding glass nuts
Grandma was "Ma" and Auntie was "Sis"
She was my best friend even taught me how to kiss
You was in and out always get up in some shit
Quick to lock a door, while that blood is dripping from your lip
I learnt nothing from you, you took my chain cause you said it glist
I was only 8 I still loved you cause ignorance is bliss
You's a bitch probably in the bathroom rubbing on your clit
Claim you committing suicide, motherfucker then slit your wrist
I'm different from you, because you live to die and i die to live
Good riddance for you, cause you a handicap with nothing to give
Go fuck yourself cause you better off not having a kid
Got two sisters pregnant now they brothers and cousins and shit
Confused as fuck, a lot for a toddler growing up
No wonder why I had anxiety in school throwing up
You claim you know my life but you don't know wassup
All you know is keeping it trill and that fucking stuff (what, what)
(They walk back into my life)
(Don't walk back into my life)
I wanted to be just like you
Wear Beef and Broccoli Timbs just like you
Army fatigue pants just like you
I wanted to get box braids be a man just like you
You had a move called the cycle I wanted to dance just like you
You listen to O.D.B. that was your idol
And that explains your drug habit he was a man just like you
Always getting locked up with no plans for life
You drowned your life with 40 ounces, contraband with pipes too
My chain wasn't enough, you even stole my bike too
Claimed you'd bring it back tomorrow after that I ain't like you
Always running to my ma talking 'bout you got a job
But you still begging for dollars for a fucking metro card
But I still love you uncle even though times is hard
I know you see me shining somewhere near the stars
(5,4,3,2,1)...
Ferg forever
A$AP Mob
You see that floor right there? Put your weave on it

Then he took his ass to sleep, that was only the beginning

Weave on the floor, ass up was the aim
Take clothes off, I'm about to do my thing

n****s in the cut all of these bitches getting focused
She gon' pop that pussy for a G
The spotlight is on a 10, 20 inch D
I've recorded for my n****s just in case they wanna see
She whispered in my ear, she said that she a freak
Put my hand on her lips, told a bitch "don't speak"
Keep it coming like a red nose, shake it for a treat
Said oh my god, damn it, she remind me of a masterpiece
Cause her body 'bout it, yeah, we crowd around it
And don't stop, she what, what, drop it like it's hot
That ho over the top, definition of a thot
Like she tryna give me head
After you back it up, then drop
I'm feeling like this one 'bout to pop
Feeling how Ferg was feeling when Work was 'bout to drop
n****, you know that feeling, that work you 'bout to cop
You paranoid cause they making you circle round the block
I jumped over you lames, I'm now hot
If I really wanted you dead already, you'd been shot
I ain't playing with you dames, I'm giving these fiends rocks
Spit it, I'm wicked with it, I cooked that up in the pot
Switching, twisting the floors, they wondering "will it stop?"
Started off at the bottom and ended up at the top
Started off with a dollar and ended up making gwop
All I had was a dream, been spitting since 17
And no, I ain't got time to diss you lame
n****s, they ain't fucking with my pistol game
They want molly and coke, I bought Crystal Caines
Beyonc' want you to put a ring on it
Beyonc' want you to put a ring on it
But that floor don't look right unless your weave on it
We got our ways, but ain't we human beings too?
If our lives don't matter, no lives matter
Thus life is our future, dying is unacceptable
Living for what we believe in is life itself
And that in itself is beautiful, iight
Beautiful people let's take a second and think
We continue these issues our ship will drown and we sink
This is nothing political this is so we be sync
Stick together forever and we'll weather the rain
We'll weather the storm, let's try to move on
Build a better community, so our children be on
Transform from arms and bombs like Vietnam
Teach your kid how to eat and teach your kid how to farm
Watch what you put in your body so you can live it long
Mind, body and soul in tact, proud and you strong
This rap ain't no lap it's more like a marathon
This track ain't no track just something I set it on
Live life in harmony, put love in your arms
Forgive to receive the blessing of peace and calm
Just a product of Malcolm X and Farrakhan
Martin Luther and Marvin Gaye came all to do a ghetto song
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful
People, people, people, people
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful
People, people, people, people
Beautiful people can be defined by
Her hair, her eyes, her body
Beautiful people
Beauty is behind the surface
It is the soul, the spirit
That lies beneath the soul, the skin
It is the power of that beauty that holds us
That strengthens us
It is the way we dance when we wanna cry
It is our mind that creates the definition of the beauty
Clear your mind, clear your body
Reach for the strength within
We are all beautiful people
All my beautiful people, all my beautiful people
I'm the ghetto apostle, come on, follow I'll lead you
Tell them put down the pipes, liquor bottles and needles
Treat your family right, your mommy ain't gonna need you
Grandma, auntie and cousin, OG told you about thuggin'
But he ain't amount to nothing, he on top of that oven
Then on top of that corner his little n****s be drummin'
Blicka-blocka they buck then they finna hit you with somethin'
Popping your collar pimping and this ain't nothin' 'bout stuntin'
If you ain't talking thuggin' then you ain't talkin' 'bout nothin'
Bullshit, I'm the pope, I think I am onto something
I wanna empower people, wanna empower people
White, purple and yellow, and all of my browner people
We can be positive, don't let negativity kill you

Papi, why you throwing things? Hungry Ham
We could fly to Puerto Rico and fight a mosquito
Or lounge out in Cuba even though it's illegal
Blowing Cuban cigars keeping everything on the D-low
Or brag to your friends "You never been here before?"
Baby I love you, we're celebrating, I love you
Been doing them squats, your ass tight as a glove
Fly like a dove, nobody fuckin' with us
I got the mean pipe but you supply me the drug
The pookie in New Jack City, the booty and tig ol' bitties
Blowing the color purple like Danny Glover and Silly
Versace embedded in me, all of our clothing silky
God took his time cause God damn you pretty
And I just really wanna hold ya
I'mma make you say "Uuuh" like a No Limit soldier
Then ride her like a roller-coaster
I'mma beat, beat it down like a real man's supposed to
Girl it's you I'm ready to settle down with
And do some things we've never done before (Yeah girl)
And baby this a celebration to our love making tonight
Cause I love you, I love you babe, yeah, I love you
Look, house on the water like a casino
Vacation on private islands, notifying my P.O
Margiela the peacoat, pockets full of Doritos
Counting all these Euros, they're like what the fuck is a C-Note?
Yachts with the clear water, it look like my chain
Cameras flashing, paparazzi, yeah that looks like the fame
3 M on my jacket, you can't see me the same
Motivated, I'm avoiding the lames but I'm looking for you
Ha, pretty brown nice thing
Rolex faces, bottles in them gold cases
It's ridiculous, with your body a n**** particular
That booty is big enough, she move it I pick it up
Slow down baby
Know a n**** singing we gon' make some Motown babies
Ha, a n**** change the weather when I come out
If it's raining baby, I'mma bring the sun out
Girl it's you I'm ready to settle down with
And do some things we've never done before (Yeah girl)
And baby this a celebration to our love making tonight
Cause I love you, I love you babe
You know I love ya
And I'm gon' love on you every chance that I get
Yeah, and ain't no way that I'm going to walk away
And throw it all away, oh yeah
And girl I won't lie
And all that I get it, if you're mines I spend it on you
And every time that we fight
We just fuck and we make right back up
Girl it's you I'm ready to settle down with
And do some things we've never done before (Yeah girl)
And baby this a celebration to our love making tonight
Cause I love you, I love you babe
Girl it's you I'm ready to settle down with
And do some things we've never done before (Yeah girl)
And baby this a celebration to our love making tonight
Grandma hid that hammer in her mattress from my uncle
He would listen to Wu-Tang fore walking in the jungle
Army... jacket, kitchen knife, hope he don't cut you
With a deuce-deuce up in his boot in case he getting tussles
And he will
Let it bang
And he will
Let it bang
Let it bang
Let it bang
And he will
Let it bang
Let it bang
Let it bang
Life will work out
How he turned out
Granddaddy tried to help him but he burnt out
He screamed lazy
Fuck I want you
Tried to get a job
Block party where the hoochies turned out
They would dance and sweat they perm out
And they scream we got beef keef with the handle with no prob
Cologne and liquor was his odor
Fragrance, of a riding soldier
ODB was his persona, he was high on Mars
40 ounce in this some marijuana
When grandma die from pneumonia
Now his life a roller coaster, put that shit on God
And he will
Let it bang
And he will
Let it bang
Let it bang
Let it bang
And he will
Let it bang
Let it bang
Let it bang
Bruh, I miss my crack-Head uncle
Sold Him dope in by tHe bundles
Drop down on Him, His own gun though
Fuck about family, where's my Hundo
Fore my clip go knock, knock zero
Fake n**** talking bout Q ain't real
18 slanging that Coupe Deville
Young n****, young n**** move that dope
Young n**** might get killed
Cause ain't paying my bills
Heat make tHe beef get grilled
12 years clutching tHat steel
Pop a n**** more than those pills
Pistol under the sheet when I sleep
Body n****s, I can do beats
I ain't talking bout my uncle, tHis me
Made another million tHis week
Swagger make a bili look cheap
I'm the reason why your momma OD'd
I'm the reason why your Homies ain't deep
Now you wanna talk about peace
Get the bitches all up off these streets
Wonder why you rubbing up feet
If you got High off what I sold
Platinum when He on shit row
Big belly bottle, I could still get trowed
Leave a n**** flat till His body get towed
Sad that the curb got closed
Leave Him with a Hole in his skull
And he will
Let it bang
And he will
Let it bang
Let it bang
Let it bang
And he will
Let it bang
Let it bang
She questioned my lyrics
My love for your music is bittersweet every time that I hear it
Your great-sounding art helped build my walls
And pushes me away so I won't fall
I'm thinking in my head "shit, oh my lord"
She texted me last night with all my faults
Downloaded your mixtape, it sound so good
But why you gotta say things that make me sound so small?
You talking 'bout your experience with other women
How you think that be looking?
My daddy and whole family hearing
Where's the respect? I don't feel it
And if you lose me, would you fear it?
Would you take back the silly acts that you was sharing?
About how you deceived and cheated with no caring
The honesty in music is fucking overbearing
I feel you, babe, I understand where you coming from
Just hear me out, just understand where I'm coming from
I'm not dumb, I know what I write
I don't wanna hurt you and I hate to fight
I'm conscious of everything I recite
Clench the soul through fingertips when I write
I don't really know if it's wrong or right
I feel like God put me here to shed the light
But I don't ever wanna let you go
Cause when the smoke clears, you'll still be here
Through the pain and the tears
All these years
But I don't ever wanna let you go
Cause when the smoke clears, you'll still be here
Through the pain and the tears
All these years
You ride for me
You lie for me
You would die for me
And you cry for me
But I don't ever wanna let you go
Cause when the smoke clears, you'll still be here
Through the pain and the tears
All these years
My open letter to my girl who got my back
Who's affected by the real shit in my raps
What's that name of the song, the Jay-Z track?
I was just fucking them girls, I was gon' get right back
Still tryna figure my place in this world
Ain't mean to hurt the heart of my beautiful girl
See, I talk about the real so my n****s'll learn
Try give 'em motivation so my n****s'll earn
So I talk about how I shine and fuck on dimes
Rolling in the Maybachs, seats reclined
I know it sounds kinda harsh when I speak 'bout mine
And you'll be crying in the dark and wanna leave sometime
But I don't ever wanna let you go
Cause when the smoke clears, you'll still be here
Through the pain and the tears
All these years
But I don't ever wanna let you go
Cause when the smoke clears, you'll still be here
Through the pain and the tears
All these years
But I don't ever wanna let you go
Cause when the smoke clears, you'll still be here
Through the pain and the tears
All these years
You ride for me
You lie for me
You would die for me
And you cry for me
But I don't ever wanna let you go
Cause when the smoke clears, you'll still be here
Through the pain and the tears
All these years
You ride for me
You lie for me
You would die for me
you remember Gina from down the block?
I remember, I think, I think Kwasi and them
like brought you over one day and I peeped you
then they went off in your shit like when you was doin' the music
I was like... huh don't I know son? Like I know him!
Then they was like yeah my n****, he was designin' mad long
I was like damn that shit crazy
I got the multi-colored one, the camo colored one
like I think it was red and brown
Ah, yeah
Ah, yeah
Ah, yeah
Ah, it was all at the park
Colonial Liquor was his odor
The fragrance of a rider soldier
ODB was his persona
Oh you want the power?
I got an uncle and his name psycho
He had a dance and they scream "go psycho!"
He would dance, work out and fight your ass at the park
(For the bills, for the hundred dollar bills)
And he got two sisters preggo
He fucked the other one to get one Jello
And he took both kids to the ghetto ass park
(On the hill, shit'll get really real)
He used to have the braids with the cuts in his body
Most stucked out, kept the hammer with his mommy
Grandma had the arthritis pain in her body
Kept the burner in the mattress, so her son don't catch a body
Gassed and he danced, smoked crack with his posse
Front flipped through a building window, land in the lobby
He was cut like Bruce Lee but he didn't know karate
He came home bloody screaming "nobody can stop me"
Nobody can stop me, I'm the baddest survivor on this planet
Fifty n****s better kill me, n**** cause I will do damage
Checked out the psych ward, I am nothing to manage
My life cut deep, n**** I'm nothing to bandage
I got an uncle and his name psycho
He had a dance and they scream "go psycho!"
He would dance, work out and fight your ass at the park
(For the bills, for the hundred dollar bills)
And he got two sisters preggo
He fucked the other one to get one jel-o
And he took both kids to the ghetto ass park
(On the hill, shit'll get really real)
Where they be drinking forty ounces
With the brown paper bags for the ounces
No matter what day you found his ass at the park
(Hungry Ham, fuck around and get killed)
When he got kicked out of his bitch crib
And he had nowhere to lizz-ive
Always find his ass on the benches laying at the park
After dark
Don't get it confused Uncle Psych, I love you to death
Just wanna get a couple of things off of my chest
Growing up you always was buck-wilding with stress
And though I'm older now, I don't know how to forget
I used to wear your Timbs around the house when you left
And if you had an open soda, I would finish the rest
Pretend I'm older, I like the liquor odor you left
Then put your camouflage vest on like I'm holding a tec
Then point it at the mirror like I'm holding your rep
Though that mirror wasn't me, but it was you I reflect
Wanted to be like you, jail tat on the chest
With the rugged cornrows and a stab on my neck
I'll rob shit like that you know, cause I'll rob anyone
I, I don't care. It was a 9 to 5 for me, you know
It was like a hobby to me, I was the gun man
I was the dancer, entertainer, you know what I mean?
I did it all. Like I said I had a deathwish, I'll rob anybody
If I die before I wake
At least I lived life my way
Hope that you remember me
Came up fast, bittersweet
Please prepare me mentally
'Fore you take my song on MTV
Now that you're no longer a lord that's trapped
You have graduated to the Hood Pope
You have made it to represent your people
Show them another way
Be the voice of the people who couldn't make it out the hood
Make sure my family good, my ma still in the hood
I ain't rich like they think cause I copped me one mink
They think I got me a house with a big couch and a gold sink
With a model bitch with a gold ring, big ass fish in a fish tank
Haha, you laughing, just put me in my casket
I ain't even into nagging, it's what it is, I'm passing
And though times is hard now, your success awaits them
I'm no different what y'all are saying
Ferg made it out? Well, I can play that game
You're not exempt from the growing chain
n****s forget who's afraid to change
You're the trapped lord, I will remain
Hood Pope, I'ma teach these confused folks how to maneuver
Through folks and attention, get you choked, you know
Slim model girls sniffing the coke
Fiend on the block sniffin' the dope
I wanna help, I don't know
Tell me the, antidote
How you hood and a pope
Conscious thinking, ghetto though
I'll teach you how to build a grow tree
Life like a bike and pedal slow
Now you're the voice of the guys on the corners
And the kids who have no direction, guide them
Through the trials and the tribulations
Teach them the world can be accumulated with patience
If I die before I wake
At least I lived life my way
Hope that you remember me
Came up fast, bittersweet
Please prepare me mentally
You can be you today
You can be you tonight
Know you're feeling really great
It's gong be alright
I can see it in your face
And I know you wanna fly
So get off your ass
And create your life
(Post Chorus: A$AP Ferg)
Cause you're missing opportunities
I know you're rich in opportunities
And you're missing opportunities
I know you're rich in opportunities
Oh, oh, oh
Working in Ben & Jerry's, it was scary
My life vision was blurry
You got talent, why's you here?
I'm thinking, yeah, plus I am getting a belly
I remember mama screaming
You ain't gon be like your uncle Terry
Uncle Terry on the corner selling rocks
He don't care what you tell him
He a hustler, bad muddastrudda
Riding in a brand new Lex when he pull up
He got a hood bitch from the block in the winter
He pull up on her like, Baby give me sugar, mane
Man I wish I shoulda, coulda, woulda
Woulda put a hurting on her if I hit her with the wood up
She got me dreaming
When I get outta the hood, I'm a get me something better
Cause you're missing opportunities
I know you're rich in opportunities
And you're missing opportunities
I know you're rich in opportunities
Oh, oh, oh
In VA, where I stay
They don't play, they'll tell you that to your face
Collard greens, candied yams, potato salad
Before you grub, better say your grace
Auntie Jean was kinda mean, but she had dreams
She used to sing like Tina Turner
She said, Bring my wig and bring my dress
My high heel shoes from a Sunday morning service
She said, I'll show y'all beginners
I'll still whoop that ass with a switch and a splinter
Pray for these tramps running round like a sinner
Missy wanna be a star? Well tell her she's a winner
Ayeeee, she a bad lil sumn
Love how she dance like Michael Jackson
Told me I would be number one
Just be yourself, don't be nothing like them
Picture me in the club, all the models around, bitch
Tip for the bottle girl, all the bottles around
Just bought me a brand new Bim', so I stunt when I come around
Fuck all my enemies, I'ma stunt when I come around
Hunnid swipes, got a couple hundred off a swipe
Swipe, bought a Bentley off a swipe
Swipe life, got two Rollies off a swipe
Swipe, oh, holy moly, swipe life, swipe life
Stolen identity, whenever I put it down
Fuck all my enemies, whenever they come around
My homie done did a year, n**** you held it down
So I bought him a brand new Benz, now he stunt when he come around
Hunnid swipes, got a couple hundred off a swipe
Swipe, bought a Bentley off a swipe
Swipe life, got two Rollies off a swipe
Swipe, oh, holy moly, swipe life, swipe life
My goons all in that van
My shoes all in that van
My tools all from Afghan
Poppy seed residue on my hands
Sacrifice for my gang
You test me, know you're testin' my aim
I drop them bombs all in your barrack
Barack callin' my name
I just grabbed a new Benz
Took them stocks off of that thing
I put them 4s under that bitch
Got your bitch rockin' all of my chains
I been rich a long time
That boy be still droppin' that flame
Been rich a long time
That boy there still got the cocaine
I pay for the Cad', I might swipe the card
Then I may get head, or I might wipe your broad
I'm cutthroat like that, I cut dope like this
And since I'm always on your mind, can't forget I'm rich, bitch
Swipe, got a couple hundred off a swipe
Swipe life, bought a Bentley off a swipe
Swipe, got two Rollies off a swipe
Swipe life, oh, holy moly, swipe life, swipe life
Henny, Mo' up in my coupe
Skeet is all up on her tooth
Beeper goes off, I'm like, "Who?"
Why I go off in the booth
Better be watchin' your tongue when you speak
Don't even talk to me, please
I keep that banger on me
Swipe and get all of my cheese
I bought my mom a new house
I bought my bitch a new dog
I brought my trap to the house
Bow when you talk to the lord
I come through with a banger, n****
And I put a big diamond on her finger, n****
And you know all the bad bitches hangin' with us
Couple rappers couldn't even get a table with us
Couple hater n****s always tellin' fables on us
Guys stealin' money, try the tables on us
But, fuck it, I'ma keep the money real tight
Cause I gotta keep a banger with a hundred swipes
Hunnid swipes, got a couple hundred off a swipe
Swipe, bought a Bentley off a swipe
Swipe life, got two Rollies off a swipe
If the bitch ain't on me, she on Ferg

You always telling me I got the world
Talking all that shit
Bitch you better the fuck out my face
But I don't have half of what I want to achieve
Na-na-na-na, fuck is you saying
I got to get it
She tried to tell me that the world is mine
I know that ain't true
And even though I want it all
I'm young, man, and I got everything to lose
I'm young, man, and I got everything to lose
I'm young, man, and I got everything to lose
I'm young, man, and I got everything to lose
I'm young, man, and I got everything to lose
She tried to tell me that the world is mine
But you know it ain't true, you know it ain't true
I'm tryna make a dollar, get my ass up out of Harlem
Cause you know the haters watching and the bullets ain't cool
Ain't you, attracted to a powerful motherfucker
Don't wanna be compared to these other dudes, motherfucker
Who turning so passionate when they battling motherfuckers
But never get a crib up in Malibu motherfucker
And I don't want to wind up like him
Be careful, that time fold, you won't let them in
Grinding that old food, no AC or fan
No trips to Jamaica, babe you gets no tan
I wanna pull up pull up in a 4-4 or Benz
A Sprinter van, with TVs in
Your crew jump in, I'm getting those gins
And we get muhfucking high as a kite
You say that this shit mami, cause you my girl
You say you just need me and need no one else
But with your love, ambition, take over the world
Funny how it all go go
You never could know though
What happened to Tiger?
Was Kobe, you know hoes
Get caught in a photo
Lipstick on your polo
And all the trust that you build's right out the door door
Y'all went from lovebirds to looking like do-do's
And that shit gon last, for months it'll go go
And that shit gon drag, drag on like komodo
Over a bitch that look like Quasimodo, God!
Now you calling and checking in, all the time like your ass still on parole though
Wondering if you just better off solo
You paying a price, but is that what it owe though?
Praying up to God about shit that's not even holy
You like she tripping over bitches saying that they know me
Then she put the pussy on me, swear that shit control me
That shit control me, man that shit control me
Don't wish me death before I see a million
Before I see these hoes and I'm up there tell my mom that I lived it
Before they dunk a flow, motherfuckers wanna talk but think they live it, no
I be ballin' stuck up in this pivot, where you trying to go?
Stuck up in this lavish living
Fucking with ghetto hoes truth be told it's money over bitches
Gotta get this dough I'm alone in this cold world
Let's go home cause we grown girl, let's get it on
Being broke this shit ain't fucking pleasant
My daddy showed me lots of money at the age of 7
Before he went to heaven
Papa knew I'd be this way
Fucking with different bitches
To bad he couldn't see the day
But he still watching over me
The devil try to take my wings
Bounce him over the head if he stand before me, shit
I floss with nothing but the real Gs, only real n****s
Introduced me to Supreme team, yeah them real killers
And I layed a couple n****s down for the real figures
I was born in this shit that's why I claim to be the realest n****
Choppin' it up with all of the thugs
Mobbin' it up with all of the bloods
Bicin' it up with all of the homies
Sippin' it up with all the broads
How many times I've dreamed of cars
Dreams of me living large
Big stars like El Debarge
Money not a thing I'm grinding hard
Lord,.. deliver me my wishes please
I've been eating all this time can y'all n****s do the dishes, please
Don't wish me death before I see a million
Before I see these hoes and I'm up there tell my mom that I lived it
Before they dunk a flow, motherfuckers wanna talk but think they live it, no
I be ballin' stuck up in this pivot, where you trying to go?
Stuck up in this lavish living
Fucking with ghetto hoes truth be told it's money over bitches
Gotta get this dough I'm alone in this cold world
Let's go home cause we grown girl, let's get it on
Flossing diamonds to make them hate me more
Fuck the enemy
Die a slow death while you envy me
And I be ballin' like the MVPs
Motherfuckers cross me, now they're begging for my sympathy
Dreaming of millions of dollars and making bitches holla
Purple label collars and nothing but Devoni from product
Devonian nature got me caking
Every star you wanna see, in the belt, n**** I'm a make it
Stuck up in this californication
Got all the bad bitches swiping cards for that medication
And I get high, that's my meditation
All this determination got me
What in the world, n**** I'm a take it
So, give me what you got while I'm making it hot
Escalating to the top getting money 'til I drop
Sprinkle lavender then I roll up and I'm tippin'
Reminiscing on how the real Gs fuckin' did it
Thieving on n****s
Don't wish me death before I see a million
Before I see these hoes and I'm up there tell my mom that I lived it
Before they dunk a flow, motherfuckers wanna talk but think they live it, no
I be ballin' stuck up in this pivot, where you trying to go?
Stuck up in this lavish living
Fucking with ghetto hoes truth be told it's money over bitches
Gotta get this dough I'm alone in this cold world
Let's go home cause we grown girl, let's get it on
I be on the same shit Master Farak was teaching Elijah
I be with the same click shout outs to Bari and Elijah
Shout outs to Dev the young messiah
Shout outs to all of the young disciples
Shout outs to Rocky for pumpin' the fire
Toast up to the most high for making us higher
Those in the skies to the angels above
Don't feel the cries of them n****s below
Rollin' my eyes to the back of my dome
But I take one poke cause I don't really smoke
Hell if I could then I'd take one toke
Cause all of this pain ain't no joke
I feel the rain but my clothes ain't soaked
It's just no grub but it ain't got dope
If there's no bub then I ain't go hoes

I can see pearly gates, matter fact I've just changed my mind
I don't wanna go, go, think I'm going out of my mind
I can hear my heart beat, think I'm running out some time
Where do I go from here, do I lay here and just die?

Hi my name is Becky, and I used to wanna be famous
I sniffed away my brains, and the itches make me insane, oh

Used to travel with the Indiana Pacers

Cause now I'm faded, now my whole world is jaded

Ms. Meagan Meagan Good you looking good on the t.v screen
This movie making me sick I think I need some codeine
Dr-Dripping from the tub and make me zone into a dream
Where one day you'll become my wife and we'll maybe have some mini me's
Laying here drowsy, and it's hard for me to see
That I've become infatuated with your perfect T
And those perfect lips, and them ass cheeks
Come into my funeral before I past cease
Cause I'd rather be dead than not in your possession
I'll meet you after life in 1 second
To hell if she ain't fucking with me
Oh, to hell if she ain't fucking with me
Hell ain't what I thought it was I wanna come back
Raping all these hoes while the devil just laugh
And it's hot as fucking shit, hotter than when I got clashed
Fuck your worshiping these bitches you know God done slack
I wear wool patch with a gasoline hat
Top of the hill made a track but the money made back
That's the devil favorite song he wrote that shit until it finish
In-love with every second, and hopes the shit is finished
But the shit keep on spinning and spinning and spinning
And if I spray "Rawr" then a n**** catch feelings
A re-precaution crew, 6000 deaths
And if I pick this gun it's a thousand left n****
To hell if she ain't fucking with me (fucking with me)

Bring nothing to your life, you die, you die
Basing your life upon the hope that you gon' get the same high
I remember when I was lit the fuck up
I just... I just remember that day
Tripping off this weed got a n**** slow motion
Chills all over my body like some cold lotion
Tryna wrestle demons like I'm fucking Hulk Hogan
Looking for the cure but I'm seeing no potion
Tryna sleep it off but it only gets worse
Seems like my whole life fucking been cursed
Devil tryna get me in this fucking paradise
They told me West got robbed (Damn)
Where the fuck them n****s be at
They took the chain up off his neck
I heard the mac started running laps
Oh, what the fuck are they goin' to do that
My n**** got stuffed he didn't want to view that
I herd they had guns I didn't want to use that
I ain't want to see Tom in the fucking boo cap
What about Lil Mitt were the fuck he was at
That n**** too little, they ain't want to do that
They got more hearts then most of them cats
If he had that thing, that thing go blat
Lil young trap lord with a little backpack
Feel at his pulse with a bunch of big gats
They ain't want to do that
Semi auto tech
Guns go flirt
And another one squirt
Linches on my mind
And now they got my brother
Thinking about picking up my nine
And making them fuckers lick the blood up
No need for wasting time
Them n****s gon' get it one way or another
You want to live the street life
Go ahead go ahead
Yo wicked blown living that street life
You can't live long living this street life
Got to watch your moms in this street life
They'll come to your home in that street life
4 flip from the chrome in that street life
Your chromosomes all on that street life
Some body gon' die
Body on ice
Her hands all on my fade, bitch pop that ass in the coup
That bitch got Lisa Leslie money, she balling, Cheryl Swoops
She keep rubbing her nose, I can tell she wanna snoop
That coke make my dick numb, she put it all in her glutes
Feel like Bishop from Juice, gun all in my boot
Sayonara feeling sauna when I blast that ass with that Uz', ooh
Blast that ass with that Uz', better hope to God it ain't you
Trap Lord with about ten jeeps, no telling what I might do
I fucked your bitch, n**** and she about to fuck my crew
She just finished with Twelvyy and now she off to loot
Pussy-ass n**** wearing all black, claim they off to shoot
I pray to God he ain't lying, my gorillas live in the zoo
I got killers with the deuce-deuce, them Tan Boys my n****s
They gon' ride with me too, bust they nines with me too
That's my bilingual crew, who do sign language true
Bandannas in they pockets, how the fuck we gon' lose?
I fucked your bitch, n****, I fucked your bitch
I fucked your bitch, n****, I fucked your bitch
She suck my dick, n****, she suck my dick
She suck my dick, n****, she suck my dick
Ride around town with about 100 n****s
When you see me come around, don't try to run up on a n****
Fo', pow, lay 'em down, now you six feet under, n****
If you flip some type of weight, let me see you dump n****
Ride around my city, feeling like P. Diddy
Glock 9 in my silk shirt, n****, no pocket, no Biggie
Spilling on, my teeth hurt but these grills worth a milli
I was in the club, I seen the whole thing, I was right next to Meek Milly
Shout outs my n**** Chrissy, don't bug over these bitches
I ain't fucking with these ratchet hoes, I put a slug in these bitches
Pop a pill in her asshole, put drugs in these bitches
Impress my girl, she fine as fuck so I ain't loving these bitches
I just be fucking these bitches, ain't no love for these bitches
Diamond dollers, that Fergenstein, I DDP on these n****s
Feel the heat when it bigger, bullet creeped to his window
n**** I'm going double wood, fuck around and catch a splinter
Nine milli, my n****, get hung, high ceiling, my n****
All the macks in they Maybachs, no 550, my n****
They saying Ferg went from "Kissin' Pink" to a Young 50, my n****
I'm in court for your bitch ass, real shit, my n****
Get the fuck out my mothafuckin' face
Who's Dr. Greenthumb, anybody seen him
Not another white bitch, time for a re-run
Need some green sum, seen some homie
Send you a ton but I keep some homie
King of Queens, look on your blades
Whole team on lean on peace of sway
The ghetto and the pump got a critter on splatter
Have another hit but I want to hit the shatter
Dabbing all night really got me fadded
Take a hit of my shit feel upgraded
Twist that shit like your weed got braided
Chilling in the palm trees feeling real shaded
Pass that shit like a deadly virus
She want to hit, that's Miley Cyrus
Head so hard, my God, she likes this
Change that chick's name to Miley Cypress
A$AP Ferg, A$AP mobbin'
Bitches on my ballsack wanna n**** martian
And a Miss America, picking any target
Bitch give me long neck like an ostrach
Aston Matthew in an Aston Marton, driving retarded
Sipping on that Crissy cause a n**** really ballin'
Headed to the telly with a bunch of Kelly Clarksons
Another broad and kiss and massage 'em
Give them booty shots might Nicki Minaj 'em
Don't let 'em get me hard then
Tell they freind give me jaws like a shark finn
You'll play Halle Berry in Monster Ball and
I'll be trap lord Billy Bob Thorton
Oh, shit, who let these Hulk Hogan hoes in with nose and chest open
That water hoes got us sipping, that molly may got us dripping

Where you lay at, gang colder than face off, you don't want to face that

Four boats so the hoes drop, that rose gold keep it don't stop
Haaan, molly party, molly party, them bitches know
It's a molly party, dodging cases cause I'm dropping bodies
#1 Stunna camoflage Hummer, nose job had to paint white for the summer
I'm a hitstick drummer, havey weight triple H hall of fame head hunter
Minivan gram Van Damme hand in hand in the Trans-Am
Better get the fuck out my face with all that
Or get a broken beat down with a baseball bat

Got a bad bitch slim waist from the back
Ass ain't fat but her face all that
Oh, she like to fuck in my baseball cap
